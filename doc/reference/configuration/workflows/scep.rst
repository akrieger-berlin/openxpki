Configuration of the SCEP Workflow
====================================

Before you can use the SCEP subsystem, you need to enable the SCEP Server
in the general configuration. This section explains the options for the
scep enrollment workflow.


Workflow Logic
--------------

The workflow validates incoming requests against five stages. Parameters
are described in detail in the section on policy settings.

technical parameters:
    Check if key algorithm, key size and hash algorithm match the policy.
    If any of those checks fails, the request is rejected.

authentication:
    A request can either be self-signed and provide a challenge password
    or use an HMAC for authentication or is signed by a trusted certificate
    (renewal or "signer on behalf"). You can also disable authentication
    or dispatch unauthorized requests  to an operator for review.

subject duplicate check:
    The database is checked for valid certificates with the same subject.
    If issuing the certificate would exceed the configured maximum count,
    the request is dispatched to an operator wo can either reject the
    request or take actions to meet the policy.

eligibility:
    The basic idea is to check requests based on the subject or additonal
    parameters against an external source to see if enrollment is possible.
    The check counts against the approval point counter, the workflow does
    not take any special action if the check fails.

approval point:
    The first four stages are usually run in one step when the request
    hits the server. Before the certificate is issued, the request must
    have a sufficient number of approval points. Each operator approval
    is worth one point. A passed eligibility check is also worth one.


Sample Configuration
--------------------

The workflow fetches all information from the configuration system at ``scep.<servername>`` where the servername is taken from the scep wrapper configuration.

Here is a complete sample configuration::

    # By default, all scep endpoints wll use the default token defined
    # by the scep token group, if you pass a name here, it is considered
    # a group name from the alias table
    #token: ca-one-special-scep

    # A renewal request is only accpeted if the used certificate will
    # expire within this period of time.
    renewal:
        # allow renewal 14 days before the certificate expires
        notbefore: 000014
        # allow renewal with already expired certificate (usually not set)
        # replaces "allow_expired_signer", not implemented yet!
        notafter: 0

    # If the request was a replacement, optionally revoke the replaced
    # certificate after a grace period
    revoke_on_replace:
        reason_code: keyCompromise
        delay_revocation_time: +000014


    workflow:
        type: certificate_enroll
        param:
            # key: name in workflow context, value: parameter from scep wrapper
            # server and interface are always set, the mapping below is
            # the default set that is used when no map is given
            transaction_id: transaction_id
            signer_cert: signer_cert
            pkcs10: pkcs10
            _url_params: url_params
            #_pkcs7: pkcs7


    # allow rsa keys with 1020 to 2048 bit
    # the 1020 is necessary as some implementations can have
    # leading 0 in the modulus which will reduce the bitcount
    key_size:
        rsaEncryption: 1020-2048

    # allowed digest algorithms used for the CSR
    hash_type:
      - sha1
      - sha256

    authorized_signer:
        rule1:
            # Full DN
            subject: CN=.+:scepclient,.*
        rule2:
            # Full DN
            subject: CN=.+:pkiclient,.*

    policy:
        # Authentication Options
        # Initial requests need ONE authentication.
        # Activate Challenge Password and/or HMAC by setting the appropriate
        # options below.

        # if set requests can be authenticated by an operator
        allow_man_authen: 1

        # if set, no authentication is required at all and hmac/challenge is
        # not evaluated even if it is set/present in the request!
        allow_anon_enroll: 0

        # Approval
        # If not autoapproved, allow opeerator to add approval by hand
        allow_man_approv: 1

        # if the eligibiliyt check failed the first time
        # show a button to run a recheck (Workflow goes to PENDING)
        allow_eligibility_recheck: 0

        # Approval points requirede (eligibity and operator count as one point each)
        # if you set this to "0", all authenticated requests are auto-approved!
        approval_points: 1

        # The number of active certs with the same subject that are allowed
        # to exist at the same time, deducted by one if a renewal is seen
        max_active_certs: 1

        # option will be removed
        # allow_expired_signer: 0

        # If an initial enrollment is seen
        # all existing certificates with the same subject are revoked
        auto_revoke_existing_certs: 1

        # allows a "renewal" outside the renewal window, the notafter date
        # is aligned to the old certificate. Set revoke_on_replace option
        # to revoke the replaced certificate.
        # This substitutes the "replace_window" from the OpenXPKI v1 config
        allow_replace: 1

    response:
        # The scep standard is a bit unclear if the root should be in the chain or not
        # We consider it a security risk (trust should be always set by hand) but
        # as most clients seem to expect it, we include the root by default
        # If you are sure your clients do not need the root, set this to 1
        getcacert_strip_root: 0

            LOCATION: /home/pkiadm/ca-one/enroll.yaml

*The renewal period values are interpreted as OpenXPKI::DateTime relative date but given without sign.*

Upgrade from OpenXPKI v1 enrollment workflow
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you are upgrading from OpenXPKI 1.x enrollment workflow to the new one,
you must adjust several parameters in the scep server configuration.

*renewal/replace period*

The syntax for the renewal period has changed, the replace_period was
substituted by a boolean flag as a window did not make much sense::

    # old syntax
    renewal_period: 000014
    replace_period: 05

    # new syntax
    renewal:
        notbefore: 000014

    # note that the policy node already exists!
    policy:
        allow_replace: 1

*signer on behalf*

The name of the key has changed from *authorized_signer_on_behalf* to *authorized_signer* only::

    # old syntax
    authorized_signer_on_behalf:
        rule1:
            ......

    # new syntax
    authorized_signer:
        rule1:
            ......

*profile definition*

In OpenXPKI 1.0 the default profile was set in the CGI wrapper configuration.
This has been moved to a seperate node in the endpoint configuration::

    profile:
        cert_profile: I18N_OPENXPKI_PROFILE_TLS_SERVER
        cert_subject_style: enroll


Workflow Configuration
----------------------

technical validation
++++++++++++++++++++

Configure the list of allowed key and hash algorithms.

**key_size**

A hash item list for allowed key sizes and algorithms. The name of the option must be
the key algorithm as given by openssl, the required byte count is given as a range in
bytes. There must not be any space between the dash and the numbers. Hint: Some
implementations do not set the highest bit to 1 which will result in a nominal key
size which is one bit smaller than the requested one. So stating a small offset here
will reduce the propability to reject such a key.

**hash_type**

List (or single scalar) of accepted hash algorithms used to sign the request.

Authentication
++++++++++++++

Signer on Behalf
#################

The section *authorized_signer* is used to define the certificates which
are accepted to do a "request on behalf". The list is given as a hash
of hashes, were each entry is a combination of one or more matching rules.

Possible rules are subject, profile and identifier which can be used in
any combination. The subject is evaluated as a regexp against the signer
subject, therefore any characters with a special meaning in perl regexp
need to be escaped! Identifier and profile are matched as is.
The rules in one entry are ANDed together. If you want to provide
alternatives, add multiple list items. The name of the rule is just used
for logging purpose.

Challenge Password
##################

The request must carry the password in the challengePassword attribute.
The sample config above shows a static password example but it is also
possible to use request parameters to lookup a password using connectors::

    challenge:
       mode: bind
       value@: connector:scep.connectors.challenge
       args:
       - "[% context.cert_subject %]"

    connectors:
        challenge:
            class: Connector::Builtin::Authentication::Password
            LOCATION: /home/pkiadm/ca-one/passwd.txt

This will use the cert_subject to validate the given password against a list
found in the file /home/pkiadm/ca-one/passwd.txt. For more details, check the
man page of OpenXPKI::Server::Workflow::Activity::Tools::ValidateChallengePassword

Renewal/Replace
###############

A request is considered to be a renewal if the request is *not* self-signed
but the signer subject matches the request subject. Renewal requests pass
authentication if the signer certificate is valid in the current realm and
neither revoked nor expired. You can allow expired certificates by setting
renewal.notafter (Not implemented yet!).

Manual Authentication
#####################

If you set the *allow_man_authen* policy flag, request that fail any of the
above authentication methods can be manually authenticated via the UI.

No Authentication
###################

To completly skip authentication, set *allow_anon_enroll* policy flag.

Subject Checking
++++++++++++++++

The policy setting *max_active_certs* gives the maximum allowed number
of valid certificates sharing the same subject. If the certificate count
after issuance of the current request will exceed this number, the
workflow stops in the PENDING_POLICY_VIOLATION state. There are several
settings that influence this check, based on the operation mode:

Initial Enrollment
##################

If you set the *auto_revoke_existing_certs* policy flag, all certificates
with the same subject *will be revoked* prior to running this check. This
does not make much sense with *max_active_certs* larger than 1 as all
certificates will be revoked as soon as a new enrollment is started! The
intended use is replacement of broken systems where the current certificate
is no longer used anyway.

Renewal/Replace
###############

If the request is a renewal or replacement request, it is allowed to
exceed the max_active_certs by one.


Eligibility
+++++++++++

The default config has a static value of 1 for renewals and 0 for initial
requests. If you set *approval_points* to 1, this will result in an
immediate issue of certificate renewal requests but requires operator
approval on initial enrollments.

Assume you want to use an ldap directory to auto approve initial requests
based on the mac address of your client::

    eligible:
        initial:
            value@: connector:your.connector
            args:
            - "[% context.cert_subject %]"
            - "[% context.url_mac %]"

    connectors:
        devices:
            ## This connector just checks if the given mac
            ## exisits in the ldap
            class: Connector::Proxy::Net::LDAP::Simple
            LOCATION: ldap://localhost:389
            base: ou=devices,dc=mycompany,dc=com
            filter: (macaddress=[% ARGS.1 %])
            binddn: cn=admin,dc=mycompany,dc=com
            password: admin
            attrs: macaddress

To have the mac in the workflow, you need to pass it with the request as an url
parameter to the wrapper: `http://host/scep/scep?mac=001122334455`.

For more options and samples, see the perldoc of
OpenXPKI::Server::Workflow::Activity::Tools::EvaluateEligibility

Approval
++++++++

A request is approved if it reaches the number of approvals defined by the
*approval_points* policy setting. As written above, you can use a data source
to get one approval point via the eligibility check. If a request has an
insufficient number of approvals, the workflow will stop and an operator
must give an approval using the WebUI. By raising the approval points
value, you can also enforce a four-eyes approval. If you do not want manual
approvals, set the policy flag *allow_man_approv* to zero - all requests
that fail the eligibility check will be immediately rejected.

Certificate Configuration
-------------------------

SCEP Server Token
+++++++++++++++++

This is the cryptographic token used to sign and decrypt the SCEP
communication itself. It is not related to the issuing process of
the requested certificates!

The crypto configuration of a realm (crypto.yaml) defines a default token
to be used for all scep services inside this realm. In case you want
different servers to use different certificates, you can add additional
token groups and reference them from the config using the *token* key.

The value must be the name of a token group, which needs to be registered
as an anonymous alias::

    openxpkiadm alias --realm ca-one --identifier <identifier> --group ca-one-special-scep --gen 1

Note that you need to care yourself about the generation index. The token will
then be listed as anonymous group item::

    openxpkiadm alias --realm ca-one

    === anonymous groups ===
    ca-one-special-scep:
      Alias     : ca-one-special-scep-1
      Identifier: O9vtjge0wHpYhDpfko2O6xYtCWw
      NotBefore : 2014-03-25 15:26:18
      NotAfter  : 2015-03-25 15:26:18



Profile Selection / Certificate Template Name Extension
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This feature was originally introduced by Microsoft and uses a Microsoft
specific OID (1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2). If your request contains this OID
**and** the value of this oid is listed in the profile map, the workflow
will use the given profile definition to issue the certificate. If no OID
is present or the value is not in the map, the default profile from the
server configuration is used.

The map is a hash list::

    profile_map:
        tlsv2: I18N_OPENXPKI_PROFILE_TLS_SERVER_v2
        client: I18N_OPENXPKI_PROFILE_TLS_CLIENT


Subject Rendering
+++++++++++++++++

Subject rendering is based on the profile and subject information given
in the config::

    profile:
        cert_profile: I18N_OPENXPKI_PROFILE_TLS_SERVER
        cert_subject_style: enroll

The subject will be created using Template Toolkit with the parsed subject hash
as input vars. The vars hash will use the name of the attribute as key and pass
all values as array in order of appearance (it is always an array, even if the
attribute is found only once!). You can also add SAN items but there is no way
to filter or remove san items that are passed with the request, yet.

Example: The default TLS Server profile contains an enrollment section::

    enroll:
        subject:
            dn: CN=[% CN.0 %],DC=Test Deployment,DC=OpenXPKI,DC=org

The issued certificate will have the common name extracted from the incoming
request but get the remaining path compontens as defined in the profile.


Revoke on Replace
+++++++++++++++++

If you have a replace request (signed renewal with signer validity outside
the renewal window), you can trigger the automatic revocation of the signer
certificate. Setting a reason code is mandatory, supported
values can be taken from the openssl man page (mind the CamelCasing), the
delayed_revocation_time is optional and can be relative or absolute date as consumed
by OpenXPKI::DateTime, any empty value becomes "now"::

    revoke_on_replace:
        reason_code: superseded
        delayed_revocation_time: +000002

The above gives your friendly admins a 48h window to replace the certificates
before they show up on the next CRL.

Note: Without any other measures, this will obviously enable an attacker
who has access to a leaked key to obtain a new certificate. We used this
to replace certificates after the Heartbleed bug with the scep systems
seperated from the public network.

Misc
----

**workflow.type**

The name of the workflow that is used by this server instance.

**response.getcacert_strip_root**

The scep standard is a bit unclear if the root should be in the chain or not.
We consider it a security risk (trust should be always set by hand) but as
most clients seem to expect it, we include the root by default. If you are
sure your clients do not need the root and have it deployed, set this flag
to 1 to strip the root certificate from the getcacert response.

The workflow context
--------------------

*outdated - needs adjustment for new workflow*

The workflow uses status flags in the context to take decissions. Flags are boolean if not stated otherwise. This is intended to be a debugging aid.

**csr_key_size_ok**

Weather the keysize of the csr matches the given array. If the key_size definition is missing, the flag is not set.

**have_all_approvals**

Result of the approval check done in CalcApproval.

**in_renew_window**

The request is within the configured renewal period.

**num_manual_authen**

The number of given manual authentications. Can override missing authentication on initial enrollment.

**scep_uniq_id_ok**

The internal request id is really unique across the whole system.

**signer_is_self_signed**

The signer and the csr have the same public key. Note: If you allow key renewal this might also be a renewal!

**signer_authorized**

The signer certificate is recognized as an authorized signer on behalf. See *authorized_signer_on_behalf* in the configuration section.

**signer_signature_valid**

The signature on the PKCS#7 container is valid.

**signer_sn_matches_csr**

The request subject matches the signer subject. This can be either a self-signed initial enrollment or a renewal!

**signer_status_revoked**

The signer certificate is marked revoked in the database.

**signer_trusted**

The PKI can build the complete chain from the signer certificate to a trusted root. It might be revoked or expired!

**signer_validity_ok**

The notbefore/notafter dates were valid at the time of validation. In case you have a grace_period set, a certificate is also valid if it has expired within the grace period.

**valid_chall_pass**

The provided challenge password has been approved.

**valid_kerb_authen**

Request was authenticated using kerberos (not implemented yet)

**csr_profile_oid**

The profile name as extracted from the Certificate Type Extension (Microsoft specific)
