=head2 create_workflow_instance

Create a new workflow instance of the given type.

Limitations and requirements:

Each workflow MUST start with a state called I<INITIAL> and MUST have exactly
one action. The factory presets the context value for I<creator> with the
current session user, the inital action SHOULD set the context value I<creator>
to the ID of the (associated) user of this workflow if this differs from the
system user. Note that the creator is afterwards attached as a workflow
attribute and will not be updated if you change the context value later on.

Workflows that fail to complete the I<INITIAL> action are not saved and can not
be continued.

B<Parameters>

=over

=item * C<workflow> I<Str> - workflow name

=item * C<params> I<HashRef> - workflow parameters. Optional, default: {}

=item * C<ui_info> I<Bool> - set to 1 to also return detail informations about
the workflow that can be used in the UI
