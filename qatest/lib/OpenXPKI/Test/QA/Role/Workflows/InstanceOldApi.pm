# Constructor attributes
#

=head2 new

Constructor: creates a new workflow instance or fetches an existing workflow's state.

Named parameters:

=over

=item * C<oxitest> I<OpenXPKI::Test> - instance of the test object

=item * C<type> I<Str> - new workflow: workflow type (i.e. name)

=item * C<params> I<HashRef> - new workflow: workflow parameters. Default: {}

=item * C<id> I<Str> - existing workflow: ID

=back

=cut

has oxitest => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => 'OpenXPKI::Test',
);

has type => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => 'Str',
);

has params => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => 'HashRef',
    default => sub { {} },
);

has id => (
    is => 'rw',
);

=head2 last_wf_state

Returns the workflow status I<HashRef> as returned by the last execution of the
C<execute_workflow_activity> API command.

    is => 'rw',

=head2 metadata

Queries the API for the current workflow metadata and returns it (I<HashRef>).

=cut
sub metadata {
    my ($self) = @_;
    my $data = $self->oxitest->api_command(
        get_workflow_info => { ID => $self->id }
    );
    $self->last_wf_state($data->{WORKFLOW}) if $data->{WORKFLOW};
    return $data;
}

=head2 state

Returns the current workflow state. Please use L</metadata> to get current
informations.

=cut
sub state {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->last_wf_state->{STATE};
}

=head2 execute

Executes the API command I<execute_workflow_activity> as a test.

Example:

    $wf->execute(
        "csr_ask_client_password",
        { _password => "m4#bDf7m3abd" },
    );

B<Positional Parameters>

=over

=item * C<$activity> I<Str> - workflow activity name

=item * C<$params> I<HashRef> - parameters

=back

=cut
sub execute {
    my ($self, $activity, $params) = @_;

    my $result;

    } "Executing workflow activity $activity";

    return $result;
}

=head2 execute_fails

Executes the API command I<execute_workflow_activity> as a test and expect
it to fail with the given exception.

Example:

    $wf->execute_fails(
        "csr_ask_client_password",
        { _password => "m4#bDf7m3abd" },
        qr/MyException/,
    );

B<Positional Parameters>

=over

=item * C<$activity> I<Str> - workflow activity name

=item * C<$params> I<HashRef> - parameters

=item * C<$failure> I<Regex> - Regular expression that the exceptions is matched agains

=back

=cut

    my ($self, $activity, $params, $failure) = @_;

    my $result;
    throws_ok {
        $self->oxitest->api_command(
            execute_workflow_activity => {
                ID => $self->id,
                ACTIVITY => $activity,
                PARAMS => $params // {},
            }
        );
    } $failure, "Executing workflow activity $activity should fail";
}

=head2 state_is

Checks the state of the workflow (with a L<Test::More> test).

This command only works if the workflow has previously been modified by this
classes methods.

B<Positional Parameters>

=over

=item * C<$expected_state> I<Str> - expected current workflow state

=back

=cut
sub state_is {
    my ($self, $expected_state) = @_;
    is $self->state, $expected_state, "workflow state is '$expected_state'";
}
